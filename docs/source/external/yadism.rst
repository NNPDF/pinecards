Yadism
======

Runcard structure
-----------------

- The ``observable.yaml`` file (compulsory). This file contain the description
  of the observable requested (kind and kinematics), together with further
  parameters specifying the process, and the details of the |yadism| calculation

Output
------

- ``DATASET.yaml``: is the other |yadism| output format, fully human readable
  (but a bit verbose)
