\subsection{PineAPPL}
\label{sec:pineappl}

In this paper we introduce a new program called \textsc{PineAPPL}, which solves the same problem as \textsc{APPLgrid}~\cite{} and \textsc{fastNLO}~\cite{}, but also supports EW corrections, which are the main interest here.
In particular, the following features distinguish it from the two aforementioned programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item support for arbitrary fixed-order calculations in $\alpha$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ with
\item support for scale variations in multiples of the central renormalization and factorization scale,
\item support for all-order predictions from resummation and photon-/parton-showers,
\item a simple \textsc{C}-interface, with a wrapper for \textsc{Fortran}
\item and support for it implemented in \textsc{mg5\_aMC@NLO},
\item converters to convert \textsc{APPLgrids} and \textsc{fastNLO} tables.
\end{itemize}
