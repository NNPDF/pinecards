###############################################################################

The current development branches of MG5_aMC are
- QCD corrections only:
	https://code.launchpad.net/~mg5core1/mg5amcnlo/2.6.5

- QCD+EW corrections:
	https://code.launchpad.net/~maddevelopers/mg5amcnlo/3.0.2

Everybody can read from these branches, but only developers can commit and push.

###############################################################################

The development branches intended to be used for this project, with full
access credentials to us, are respectively

https://code.launchpad.net/~amcblast/+junk/2.6.5
https://code.launchpad.net/~amcblast/+junk/3.0.2

They can be downloaded using bazaar (may be already installed on your machine)
http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/
with the command 
> bzr branch lp:~amcblast/+junk/2.6.5

(analogously for 3.0.2)

Once downloaded, from inside the 2.6.5 directory, you can run  
 > bzr pull
to import recent changes

After modifying the code, use
> bzr commit 
to commit the changes. At variance with git, there is no need to
add the modified files to the list of files to be committed.

> bzr add 
can still be used to add new files to the repository, before the commit stage

Finally, the online repository can be updated with 
> bzr push
