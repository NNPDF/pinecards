  \caption{The 34 parton luminosities contributing to the predictions, accurate
    to NLO QCD+EW, of the Drell--Yan lepton-pair production measured by the
    ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of
    \SI{7}{\tera\electronvolt}~\cite{Aad:2013iua}. The ten largest contributions
    to the cross section (irrespective of their sign) are reported, in
    percentage, for each bin. Empty spaces typically denote contributions
    smaller than a fraction of percent. The bin edges are in the invariant mass
    of the lepton pair, $M_{\ell\bar\ell}$, as follows: 116, 130, 150, 170, 190,
    210, 230, 250, 300, 400, 500, 700, 1000, 1500 [GeV].
