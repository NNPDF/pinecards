This is a BASH script which is run after the successful generation of the
PineAPPL grid and can be used to perform additional operations, such as
rescaling. The environment variable ``$GRID`` contains the relative path the

one-dimensional histograms generated by Madgraph5_aMC@NLO into higher
dimensional ones with the proper limits.
